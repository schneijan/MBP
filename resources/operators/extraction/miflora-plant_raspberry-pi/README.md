# Extraction Operator: Scripts to extract several sensor data from MiFlora plant sensor

This folder contains scripts for reading sensor values of a :seedling: `MiFlora plant sensor` via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) .

## Hardware Setup

 - a Raspberry Pi 3B (Stretch or Buster) with Bluetooth or Laptop running Ubuntu OS with Bluetooth
 - a [MiFlora plant sensor](https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Detector-Automatically-Fertility-Temperature/dp/B0851FBJ3C/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1RJGTJ4ILBROL&dchild=1&keywords=mi+flora+plant+sensor&qid=1612649828&sprefix=mi+flora%2Caps%2C238&sr=8-1)

## Parameters

 :warning: The following `parameters` need to be provided on installation of the the operator. Upon registration of this operator, add  the following as parameters:

 - `"sensor" (text)`: name of sensor to read the values. When starting this operator in the sensor detail view, provide on of the following as input value: 
- `temperature` for the temperature in Â°C
   - `light` for light values, the bigger the value, the brighter it is 
   - `moisture` for soil humidity
   - `conductivity` for the fertility of the soil. There are nutrient range values for different plants, or
   - `battery` for the battery status
- `"mac" (text)`: MAC address of the plant sensor. When starting this operator in the sensor detail view, provide as input the MAC address of your MiFlora plant sensor, for example, `C4:7C:8D:66:B0:15`. To find out the MAC address, you can use the command `$ sudo hcitool lescan` in a Linux PC, which scans all available Bluetooth devices. MiFlora sensors have the name `flower care`.

Optional parameter:

* `"interval" (number)`: the desired time interval between two sensor measurements in seconds. 

## Operator files

 - `mbp_client.py`: This python script contains the logic to connect and to communicate with the MBP. It abstracts a MQTT client and further configuration steps.  
 - `entry-file-name`: This file contains solely the name of the user-defined main python script including its extension. 
 - `miflora-plant_raspberry-pi.py`: This script communicates with the MiFlora sensor via BLE and  uses the `mbp_client` to send data to the MBP.  
 - `install.sh`: This file installs the necessary libraries to run the `mbp_client` and the main python script.  
 - `start.sh`: This file starts the execution of the main python script, the one indicated in the `entry-file-name`.  
 - `running.sh`: This file checks if the main python script is running.  
 - `stop.sh`: This file stops the execution of the main python script.
 - `dataModel.json`: This file contains a data model definition which can be used for the creation of a respective operator entity in the MBP.
