# Extraction Operator: Parametrized scripts to simulate data of an acceleration sensor

This folder contains 3 folders with operator scripts to simulate the data of the different axis of an acceleration sensor. 
Together they simulate the idle state or the movement/acceleration of an object. This events can be combined with anomalies. 
The scripts take input parameters upon their deployment.

## Operators  

 - `sensoradapter_accX`: Contains Operator scripts to simulate the data of the X-axis of the acceleration sensor.
 - `sensoradapter_accY`: Contains Operator scripts to simulate the data of the Y-axis of the acceleration sensor.
 - `sensoradapter_accZ`: Contains Operator scripts to simulate the data of the Z-axis of the acceleration sensor.
