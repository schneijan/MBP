# Extraction Operator: Parametrized scripts to plann the simulation of acceleration sensor data

This folder contains 3 folders with operator scripts for a planned simulation of the data of the different axis of an acceleration sensor. The scripts take input parameters upon their deployment.

## Operators  

 - `sensoradapter_accXPl`: Contains Operator scripts to plann the simulation of the data of the X-axis of the acceleration sensor.
 - `sensoradapter_accYPl`: Contains Operator scripts to plann the simulation of the data of the Y-axis of the acceleration sensor.
 - `sensoradapter_accZPl`: Contains Operator scripts to plann the simulation of the data of the Z-axis of the acceleration sensor.
