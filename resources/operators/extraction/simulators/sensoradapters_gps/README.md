# Extraction Operator: Parametrized scripts to simulate data of an GPS sensor

This folder contains 3 folders with operator scripts to simulate the data of the different axis of an GPS sensor. Together they simulate moving away from and approaching a smart home, for example. This events can be combined with anomalies. The scripts take input parameters upon their deployment. The simulator can be used in the case of an IoT-Application where actions should be triggered on  approaching or moving away from a house. 
## Operators  

 - `sensoradapter_gps_lat`: Contains Operator scripts to simulate the data of the X-axis (Latitude) of the GPS sensor.
 - `sensoradapter_gps_long`: Contains Operator scripts to simulate the data of the Y-axis (Longitude) of the GPS sensor.
 - `sensoradapter_gps_hight`: Contains Operator scripts to simulate the data of the Z-axis (Hight) of the GPS sensor.
