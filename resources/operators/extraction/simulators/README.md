# MBP Simulation Operators

This folder contains simulators of different sensors, which can generate sensor data for different events combined with anomalies. These simulators can be used for testing IoT-Applications to detect failures and take action against them. For this purpose you can use the "Testing Tool" within the MBP. In the process, stable and correctly working IoT-Applications can be created.
