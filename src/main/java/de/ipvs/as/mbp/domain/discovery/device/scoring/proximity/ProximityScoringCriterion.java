        Transformation: At this point, the distance needs to be transformed to a score by making use of the
        user-provided input. The following approach (with distance d >= 0) is used, resulting in a limited
        decrease function that strives against the asymptote of zero:
        score(d) = max_score * a^d (when d > 0, this is equivalent to score(d) = max_score * exp(ln(a) * d))

        For the half score distance h > 0 it is known:
        score(h) = max_score * a^h = max_score / 2
        <=> a^h = 1/2                                (now exponentiating both sides of the equation by (1/h))
        <=> a = (1/2)^(1/h) = 2^(-1/h)

        From this result it can already be seen that 0 < a < 1 which in the end will result in a decrease function.
        When putting all together, the following transformation function results:
        score(d) = max_score * 2^(-d/h)

        This formula can be easily validated when using h as input, since this leads to
        score(h) = max_score * 2^(-h/h) = max_score * 2^(-1) = max_score / 2
        while
        score(0) = max_score * 2^(0/h) = max_score
        and
        lim(d -> inf) max_score * 2^(-d/h) = lim(d -> inf) max_score * 0 = 0
