/**
 * The purpose of this task is to deploy a given {@link DynamicDeployment} with respect to the ranking which
 * can be computed from the candidate devices in the {@link CandidateDevicesContainer} that is associated
 * with the {@link DeviceTemplate} underlying the {@link DynamicDeployment}. Thereby, the operator of the
 * {@link DynamicDeployment} is supposed to be deployed to the target device of the ranking that can be considered
 * as most appropriate. If necessary, this task also takes care of suspending possibly existing former deployments
 * of the {@link DynamicDeployment} by undeploying the corresponding {@link Operator} from its former target device.
 * The decision for the target device and whether a (re-)deployment is necessary is done according to the following
 * procedure:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>All devices of the device candidates ranking are considered in ascending order of their rank.</li>
 *     <li>If the dynamic deployment is currently already deployed to a device and the currently considered device
 *     has a score that is lower than or equal to the score of this former device in the new ranking, the former
 *     device is continued to be used.</li>
 *     <li>Otherwise, it is tried to deploy the operator to the current device. If the deployment fails, the next
 *     device in the ranking is considered.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * This way, it is ensured that re-deployments of already deployed {@link DynamicDeployment} are only executed
 * in case a device is available that appears to be really better suited than the currently used device.
